# 22.211

## P-set 1 notes
For this Pset I used Steven Johnson's c Faddeeva library (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Faddeeva_Package). 
This is included as an external library.To compile it you need to first compile Faddeeva.cc as a libary. In g++ the -s flag will
do this. When compiling the whole library you need include the compiled library as the argument after the cpp file.

For the linear algebra solver Eigin was used (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org). You need to download the header files and install them or symlink then in /usr/local/include.
