## P-set 1 notes
For this Pset I used Steven Johnson's c Faddeeva library (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Faddeeva_Package). 
This is included as an external library.To compile it you need to first compile Faddeeva.cc as a libary. In g++ the -s flag will
do this. When compiling the whole library you need include the compiled library as the argument after the cpp file.
