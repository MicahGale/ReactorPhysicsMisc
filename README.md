## Single-Level Bright-Wigner (SLBW)
The Single-level Bright-Wigner is the simplest model for calculating the cross-section for a nuclear resonance. In these projects I calculated the cross-section of Uranium-238 at low energies (only for 6.67eV resonance). Using this a one-group cross-section and flux were calculated for various homogenous mixtures. This used the narrow and wide-resonance models.

## Open Monte Carlo (OpenMC)
[OpenMC](https://openmc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo transport solver developed by the MIT Computational Reactor Physics Group to research next-generation Monte-Carlo solvers. In this work I used openMC to complete a series of optimization studies on various reactor configurations to optimize the geometry to reduce the amount of fuel necessary to have in inventory.
